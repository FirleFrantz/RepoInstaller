## 🔢 Multiple apps selection
Do you have more than one signer and don't want to restart the shortcut every time to add these repos and waste your time? Well, with Repo Installer++ **you can select more than one app** and let the shortcut do the work for you! Pretty fire, huh? 🔥
## ✅ A lot of supported apps
This shortcut supports **5 apps**, including:

|App name|From shortcut ver|Required app ver|Apps avaiable|
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
|[KravaSigner 🩷](https://kravasign.com/repo-installer)|v3.0.0|Any|-|
|Feather 🩷|v1|Any|-|
|AltStore|v1|Any|-|
|SideStore|v1|Any|-|
|ESign|v1|Any|?|

*some apps (AltStore and SideStore) are not tested and i don't know how many apps are avaiable. ESign doesn't provide a counter so idk how many apps there are, i'm not going to manually count. Apps with 🩷 are recommended by the creator of the shortcut.*

## 🤔 FAQ
Some common questions are answered here.

|Question|Answer|
| :------------: | :------------: |
|Why in some signers there are more apps than others?|Because some signers don't support some of the repos I provide.|
|Why there is the app multiple times?|Because that app is found in more than a repo, make sure you install the latest version.|
|How can i install the latest version of Null's?|I made a repo just for you! The name of the repo is *Null's Servers* and the games are always up to date. When there is a new update of the game, just install it again.|
