# ü§ù Contributing
If you want to help me add more features in Repo Installer++ you can do so by following this simple tutorial!

## Requirements
- `Shortcuts` - Obviusly
- `Jellycuts` - Needed to transform the shortcut into code

## How to contribute
1. Get the latest version of the shortcut on [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/21714/)
2. Make the changes on this shortcut (a feature, bug fix ecc.)
     - Set `beta` to `True` if you want to skip the update check
3. Open the **Jellycuts** app, press the `+` icon located in the top left corner of the screen, press `Import from Shortcuts App` and select the shortcut with the changes you made
4. On the Jellycuts app open the newly added shortcut and copy the whole code inside
5. Fork this repository
6. Edit the `repoinstaller.jelly` file and replace the contents with the copied one and save
7. Click `Contribute` and `Open pull request`
8. Write here all the details about your changes and create the pull request

**And that's it!**

## What's next?
I will review the changes and if it's good I will approve the pull request and you will see the feature on the next update!
Also you will get the *cool role* on my Discord server if you added your Discord username onto your GitHub bio!
